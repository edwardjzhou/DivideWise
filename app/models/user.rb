# :focus represents the state when the element is currently selected to receive input and
# :active represents the state when the element is currently being activated by the user.
#When clicked the button is in :focus:active state.
# transition: height 0.5s
# controlled inputs in react pretty much have to be stateful as heck or they cannot give feedback to user on value changes

#const divStyle = {

#react notes:https://zhenyong.github.io/react/docs/forms.html

#while waiting for fetch to finish in the thunk action creator we can stick a LOADING component in or just use react.suspense?

# composition of components is like composition of functions 
# ownership: a child is a pure function of its parent, its parent messes with the prop it feeds it and it jsut takes it completely owned
# child is render in parents render
#state is for me to mess with myself
#props is for me to take from my master. these could be a function of my masters state or prop too thats fine
#props never a function of state over time only initially in constructor or something like that
#getoffsetheihgt of the html tag is best
#display:none to hide a child that is stateful by hiding it 


#IRRELEVANT to my proj but useful: 
#defualt props is sort of like setting a beginning this.state in constructor
#NO MIXINS In class
# var mixinName = {
    #getDefaultProps: function() {
    # return {
    #   value: 'default value'
    # };
#}
#let objClone = { ...obj };

# given an array of bills... is it best to just do pure functional component.apply(null, array) ?
# const args = [0, 1, 2];
# myFunction.apply(null, args);

# in a createclass object {mixins: [mixinName]  ...}
# then this.getDefaultProps works because this is the mixinName object
# i still need to get "This" keyword figured out better than jsut thinking of it as the object of the caller 
# does this auto attach to inherited methods  YES

#irrelevant due to redux:
#var { checked, ...other } = props; other is used for deeper children, i use checked NOW 

#on design: need to thinka bout when a component will be used. when will it get info. is it bewtter to batch info to it or is it better for child who may come later in time to just in time it

#patterns:
# # function fancybox(props){
#   return (
#     <div>
#       props.children
#   )
# }

#'âˆš '

#i should haev plotted out the box models for all containers first before even doing any styling or worrying about parent relationships
# functional components can have lifecytcle methods i was ignorant of htis: 
# componentWillMount: function() {
#     this.intervals = [];
#   },

#need to think if a parent handles all the data or not -- for splitwise i need all the data frontloaded? that would make it easier
# but i only need payments when i click on the UI of bills-- do i frontload the data or do i do just-in-time? Arbitrary
# since this is just a get request that makes a db query that takes 50 ms i should just frontload 
# the only thing that grows as there is more users is getting all other users to be used for potential friends
# everything else doesnt grow with more users

#props.children is arbitrary code between fancybox opening tag and closing tag

#random notes: a modal is a lightbox for forms

# unique on a COLUMN means that once that once one value is matched from that column the query can stop
# unique on a composite index like [friend_user_one, friend_User_two] means that looking for a friend_user_one = 5 is sped up, or friend_1=2, friend2=3
# but friend_2 = 5 IS NOT SPED UP at all (but if friend_2 was indexed )
